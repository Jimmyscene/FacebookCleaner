		<h4>Facebook Cleaner</h4>
			<p>
				I claim no responsibility for any facebook accounts ruined due to the use of this addon. 
				It probably has bugs.
				Be very careful.
				Notes:
					When the extension calculates posts, sometimes it shows more than those that will actually be deleted. 
					This is due to automated posts like "USER was born", "User added photos to album", etc. These will not be deleted, but still show up in the count.
					The addon requires you to grant it API access. It will not work if you do not. Feel free to revoke the access after you're done.

					Known issues:
					<strike>Links? Don't delete correctly?Something is weird in 2011.</strike>
					I just suck at async.

					Should also check /feed/ node. Good way to remove all of John/Isaac's posts.
