			<p>
				I claim no responsibility for any facebook accounts ruined due to the use of this extension. <br>
				It probably has bugs.<br>
				Be very careful.<br>
				Notes:<br>
					The extension requires you to grant it API access. It will not work if you do not. Feel free to revoke the access after you're done.

					Known issues:<ul>
					<li>Does not delete "user was tagged in" posts.</li>
					<li>Does not delete photos.	</li>
					</ul>
