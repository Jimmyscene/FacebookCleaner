		<h4>Facebook Cleaner</h4>
			<p>
				I claim no responsibility for any facebook accounts ruined due to the use of this extension. <br>
				It probably has bugs.<br>
				Be very careful.<br>
				Notes:<br>
					The extension requires you to grant it API access. It will not work if you do not. Feel free to revoke the access after you're done.

					Known problems(Unlikely to be fixed due to the way Facebook's API Works):
					<ul>
						<li>Does not delete "user was tagged in" posts.</li>
						<li>Does not delete photos.	</li>
						<li>Does not delete shared posts.</li>
					</ul>
					Known Bugs(I'll fix eventually, I swear it.)
					<ul>
						<li>If user is not logged into facebook, the app will most likely have a stroke</li>

					</ul>
